# A/B Testing for Landing Page Optimization 

This project analyzes the impact of a new landing page design on user engagement and conversion rate for an online news subscription platform. The company aims to determine if the new design improves key business metrics and whether user behavior varies across preferred languages.

---

##  Problem Statement

The company randomly selects 100 users and splits them equally into:

- **Control Group**: shown the **old landing page**
- **Treatment Group**: shown the **new landing page**

The goal is to answer:
1. Do users spend more time on the new landing page?
2. Is the conversion rate higher for the new page?
3. Does preferred language influence conversion behavior?
4. Is time spent affected by language on the new page?
